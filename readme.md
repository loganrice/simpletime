##Using Grunt
You will need [node and npm](http://nodejs.org) installed. At the root of the project run the `npm install` command in terminal. After the dependencies have finished installing run `grunt` you should see output like:

    Running "express:dev" (express) task

    Running "express-server:dev" (express-server) task
    Web server started on port:9080, hostname: localhost [pid: 5654]

    Running "watch" task
    Waiting...

at this point you should be able to open the server on localhost at port 8090 (assuming you haven't updated it).

If you make changes to the html file, css or javascript files the page will automagically reload for you. Making for pure awesomeness!
